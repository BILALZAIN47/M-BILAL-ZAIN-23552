# College Database Management Project

This project was developed using **MySQL Workbench** (instead of Oracle SQL Developer/Workspace, which is not supported on my device).  

The project demonstrates the creation and management of a simple `college` database with a `student` table.  
In MySQL Workbench, the database does not auto-refresh after changes. Therefore, modifications are performed using **ALTER TABLE** commands to update the schema or structure.

## Features
- Create a database and a student table
- Insert multiple student records
- Rename columns using `ALTER TABLE`
- Delete records with conditions (e.g., based on marks)
- Drop unnecessary columns
- Sort data using `ORDER BY`
